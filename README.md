# ml-bootcamp
This repository contains homework assignments that were completed during Machine learning bookcamp (2024 December - present (2025 May))
These assignments focus on the application of various machine learning (ML) methods to practical problems. At the moment, the course is in progress and assists will be added. 

## General Knowleges
- 1-1 Fundamentals_of_statistics.ipynb
covers the basics of statistics, application of the T-test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and demonstrates basic skills in writing code for data analytics
- 1-2 Credit_EDA.ipynb
Contains a detailed exploratory analysis of lending data. This includes outlier detection, gap analysis, visualisation of categorical, continuous and mix data for visual assessment of the dataset
