# **ML Bootcamp**  
This repository contains homework assignments completed during the **Machine Learning Bootcamp** (December 2024 â€“ May 2025). The assignments focus on applying various machine learning (ML) techniques to real-world problems. The course is currently ongoing, and additional materials will be added over time.  

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This is an English translation of the original repository, where all assignments are submitted and version-controlled: [ML-Course (Original Repository)](https://github.com/ExcellentDarkTea/ML-Course).
